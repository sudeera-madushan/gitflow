# Commit Message Guidelines

When generating commit messages using Cursor's generate option, ALWAYS follow these rules:

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message MUST follow this structure:

```
<type>(<scope>): <jira issue key> - <short description>

<optional longer description>
```

## Required Components

1. **Type**: One of the commit types listed below (required)
2. **Scope**: The module or feature being modified (optional but recommended)
3. **JIRA Issue Key**: Always include an issue key (e.g., SOF-1202, JIRA-123, CUS-45) (required)
4. **Short Description**: Brief description in imperative mood (required, max 50 characters)
5. **Longer Description**: Optional detailed explanation

## Commit Types

Use ONLY these commit types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no new features, no bug fixes)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (e.g., build process, dependencies)
- `revert`: Revert a previous commit

## Common Scopes

Use appropriate scopes such as:

- `auth` (authentication)
- `dashboard`
- `api`
- `checkout`
- `database`
- `leads`
- `contacts`
- `components`
- `routing`
- `hooks`
- `utils`
- `styles`
- `config`

## Commit Message Rules

1. **Imperative Mood**: Use imperative mood (e.g., "fix bug" not "fixed bug")
2. **Subject Line**: Keep concise (50 characters max)
3. **Capitalization**: Capitalize the first letter of the commit message
4. **No Period**: Do not end the subject line with a period
5. **JIRA Key Required**: ALWAYS include a JIRA issue key (e.g., SOF-1202, JIRA-123)

## Examples

### Good Examples:

```
feat(auth): SOF-1202 - add OTP authentication for login

Implemented OTP-based authentication for secure login. This includes sending OTP via email and validating input.
```

```
fix(api): SOF-1202 - resolve CORS issue for external clients
```

```
refactor(components): SOF-1234 - extract common button logic into reusable hook
```

```
docs(readme): SOF-5678 - update installation instructions
```

### Bad Examples (DO NOT USE):

```
Fixed bug in authentication
```

(Missing type, scope, JIRA key, and wrong mood)

```
feat: add new feature
```

(Missing scope and JIRA key)

```
feat(auth): SOF-1202 - Added OTP authentication
```

(Wrong mood - "Added" instead of "add")

## Branch Naming Convention

When creating branches, follow this structure:

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

Examples:

- `feat/user-profile-page`
- `fix/payment-bug`
- `docs/api-usage`

## Important Notes

- **ALWAYS** include a JIRA issue key in every commit message
- Use the imperative mood for all commit messages
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Capitalize the first letter
- Do not end with a period
- Include scope when it adds clarity about what part of the codebase changed
